/*
 * This macro defines the positions and PWM channels of each participating LED.
 *
 * The twinkle engine calculates a PWM setting in the range 0..255 according
 * to the master light position vs the individual LED position:
 * - if the LED is further away from master than "brightness" then the LED is OFF
 * - if the LED is within half of "brightness" from master then the LED is ON
 * - otherwise a linear gradient PWM is applied according to the distance
 *
 * A selector macro is passed which will choose a parameter from the
 * configuration. For example, if you want to set channel 1 position 85 and
 * channel 0 position 170 use the macro like this
 *
 * @code
 * #define TWINKLE_PWMS(_) _(1, 85) _(0, 170)
 * @endcode

#define TWINKLE_PWMS(_) _(0, 42) _(1, 85) _(2, 128) _(3, 171) _(4, 224)
