/*
 * This macro defines the PWM channels of each participating LED.
 *
 * The fade engine calculates a PWM setting in the range 0..255 according
 * to the master PWM target, the current PWM setting and the rate of change
 *
 * A selector macro is passed which will choose a parameter from the
 * configuration. For example, if you want to control PWM channels 1, 0 and 3
 * use the macro like this
 *
 * @code
 * #define FADE_PWMS(_) _(1) _(0) _(3)
 * @endcode
